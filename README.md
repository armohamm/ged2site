ged2html
========

Create a website from a Gedcom file.

It's been tested more extensively with GedComs exported and downloaded from
FindMyPast, though it should work fine with other systems such as GenesReunited
and Ancestry.

Typical usage:

    ged2html -cFdh 'Your Name' gedfile.ged
    copy files in html to your webserver
